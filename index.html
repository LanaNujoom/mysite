      <h1>Birds Types</h1>

      <p> Birds (Aves) are a group of vertebrates which evolved from dinosaurs. They are endothermic, with feathers.
      </p>




      <p>
        Birds live all over the world. They range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.70 m (9 ft)

        ostrich. They are the class of tetrapods with the most living species: about ten thousand. More than half of

        these are passerines, sometimes known as perching birds.

        <h2> - Waterfowl Birds

        </h2>
        <p>
          Waterfowl, in the United States, all varieties of ducks, geese, and swans; the term is sometimes expanded to
          include some unrelated aquatic birds such as coots, grebes (see photograph), and loons. In Britain the term
          refers only to domesticated swans, geese, and ducks kept for ornamental purposes, wildfowl being the term used
          for wild birds of this group, especially in the context of shooting for sport. See also duck; goose; swan.
